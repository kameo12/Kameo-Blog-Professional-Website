# Kameo's blog/personal website

## Description
Personal website and blog for Kameo Bingham. Photography, Kameo Creates, Zoo Hopping, etc. 

## Custom CSS Classes
3 of the CSS selectors I used are: 
  1. Change the link color on parts of the navigation bar on hover
  2. Formatting of image of bears in a tree to be centered and display in block style
  3. Want Notification styling to center it towards the bottom of the page as a flexbox with padding. 

Some of the other class(es) I created are nav, middle info, image, and my story. This is were I made changes and customized the middle section of the website to make the products and services, image and my story align next to each other horizontally. 

## Custom JavaScript Functions
The javascript function I created is .fadeTo to fade the opacity of the headshot image when you click on it. It goes back to the original opacity once the page is refreshed again.
